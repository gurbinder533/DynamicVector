It contains code for Dynamically Allocated Arrays. 

Raw array is started with some minimum size. As you push and pop elements, it automatically allocates more space (doubles the space) to get the 
amortized time complexity for allocation.

It also contains MOVE sematics. Move assignment and Move copy constructors.
